# PYTORCH_PROJECT
This is a project using pytorch and git together. I will create a simple image detector that can guess different types of clothing.

Datasets

- data/FashionMNIST
- data/musicGENRE

## Main.py

This pytorch algorithm shows the steps of developing a NN module that can predict a song's genre. The datasets contains a varying number of genres that have different features that make up the song's tune.

### Data Processing

- missing value replacements
- sorting categorical columns

### Torch Neural Networks modules 

- simpleNN
- multiclassNN

## NeuralNetworks.py

This project explores a basic image detector.
